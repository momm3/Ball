# Ball
A simple simulation of a 2d elastic ball with initial Vx components.
Will be forked for two purposes:
1: Simulation,
I will develop this to make it more suitable for simulation in a classroom learning environment.

2: Game,
I hope to develop this into a two player "Pong" style game with multiplayer capabilities (might have to re-write in JS)
